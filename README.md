# Car-Prediction

This is a machine learing project that involves predicting fuel consumption based on the car model. In this project, I conducted analysis on the data using different statistical analysis test. Also, trained the data on machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF).
