# Car-Prediction

This is a machine learing project that involves predicting fuel consumption based on the car model. In this project, I conducted analysis on the data using different statistical analysis test. Also, trained the data on machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). Furthermore, I performed some feature engineering to the data to get optimised result. Hence, random forest regressor gave the best performance for the prediction.
